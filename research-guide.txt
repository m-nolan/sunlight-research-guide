## Aircraft Photo Websites
Links:

- JetPhotos
- PlaneSpotters


Description: Planespotting enthusiasts take photos of airplanes and upload them to websites such as Planespotters.net and JetPhotos.com. These websites occasionally provide information on the beneficial owner or lessee of an aircraft that may not be available in official registration documents. For example, photos on JetPhotos.com show that President Obama used a jet with tail number N755NA during his campaign in 2008. With this tail number, we can use plane tracking websites, described below, to track the historical movements of the plane and look for relevant patterns. We can also submit public-record requests to the FAA for passenger manifests to identify individuals who have traveled with a candidate. In addition to searching on planespotting website, keep an eye out for any aircraft that appear in campaign photos or in the backgrounds of filmed campaign rallies. 

Uses:

Description: Calling the university registrar is the most straightforward way to verify a claimed degree. However, some universities will not verify a candidate's degree without the candidate's signed authorization. In such cases, it may still be possible to verify the degree by finding a commencement program. Yearbooks, university press releases on notable aliumni, alumni newsletters, and archives of student newspaper articles are also all resources that can help verify a candidate's educational history.

 - Identify arrest and inmate records for a candidate


## County-Level Elections Authority
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: Generally, a county-level elections authority will generally maintain voter registration records and a history of past elections in which a registered voter cast a ballot.

Its expertise is one of the reasons that many businesses from all over the country and the world incorporate in Delaware. Particularly for any candidate who has been associated with a Delaware company or other publicly traded company, we need to search for any cases naming the candidate in Delaware Chancery Court. 

We use a database named File & Serve Express for this research. After logging in, use the "Search" dropdown menu to select "Cases Search." Limit your search to Delaware and the Court of Chancery, and then search by party name. Save and discuss any results with your case manager as it can be expensive to download filings from this database.

## Department of Labor Form 5500 Database
Links:

- https://www.efast.dol.gov/5500search/


Description: Under federal regulations, companies that offer 401k plans and certain other employee benefit plans must file Form 5500s with the Department of Labor. These provide intelligence on a company's employee headcount and changes to the company's business over time. For example, a candidate may claim to have managed a successful business, while Form 5500s filed with Department of Labor show that the number of participants in the company's 401k plan dwindled over time. Remember that companies may reduce the size of their workforce for reasons other than poor business performance, and many employees might not participate in a 401k plan. Some companies outsource their employee benefits to a third-party provider and do not file Form 5500s.

Uses:

## Facebook
Links:

- https://www.facebook.com/


Description: Identify a candidate's Facebook profiles and review the content available publicly. Facebook's search function is no longer very helpful for anything beyond identifying profiles. If a candidate's profile is private, there may still be publicly available content on the profiles of his or her relatives and friends. Search for the profiles of a candidate's immediate relatives to find additional content that may not be available on the candidate's profile. 

Uses:

 - Review a candidate's Facebook activity 

Associated People

 - Identify Facebook users with whom a candidate has interacted


## Federal Aviation Administration
Links:

- https://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/


Description: The FAA allows searches by the name of an aircraft's registered owner. However, many aircraft are owned by companies or trusts.

## Federal Election Commission
Links:

- https://www.fec.gov/


Description: The Federal Election Commission (FEC) collects campaign finance disclosure forms from candidates for federal elected office. Its database has several functions we will use regularly.

In the "Campaign finance data" dropdown menu, choose, "Look up contributions from specific individuals." This will allow you to research any federal campaign contributions by a specific person, such as a candidate, dating back more than 20 years.

Next, under the same dropdown menu, select "Committees." This will allow you to search for a candidate's offiical campaign committee. We want to browse both receipts and disbursements. The best way to analyze this data is to export it to Excel and then sort and filter it. Search for patterns in the data. Who are the candidate's largest supporters? Where are they from? What industries do they work in? How has the candidate spent campaign funds? Who are the campaign's largest vendors? What is the campaign's total amount of unitemized disbursements? (This can be estimated by comparing the total value of disbursements reported by the campaign and the total value of disbursements listed in the "Browse disbursements" page.

Also of interest in the FEC database are any requests for additional information that the FEC has sent to a candidate's campaign committee. These highlight inconsistencies in a campaign committee's FEC filings or potential violations of regulations, such as donors who may have exceeded controbution limits.

In the statement of organization for a candidate's official campaign committee, the campaign must disclose any joint fundraising committees in which it participates. These joint fundraising committees are arrangements that allow donors to make very large contributions, because funds are shared among each of the participants in the committee. For example, in the 2024 election cycle, an individual can make a maximum contribution of $6,600 to any one official campaign committee, but if giving to a joint fundraising committee composed of three different campaigns, the maximum individual contribution would tiple to $19,800.

The FEC allows members of the public to browse data on independent expenditures, or campaign spending by nominally independent political action committees (PACs). From the FEC home page, click on the campaign finance dropdown menu, choose "Spending," and then click on the "Independent Expenditures" link. The filters in the lefthand panel allow you to view only independent expenditures supporting or opposing a speciifc candidate. This data will allow reseachers to identify the key PACs supporting a candidate. Unlike official campaign committees, Super PACs have no contribution limits, so large donors seeking to aggressively support a candidate will often direct most of their funds to these Super PACs. Super PACs are PACs that do not provide funds to other PACs, party committees or candidate committees but instead make only independent expenditures. It is illegal for PACs and campaigns to directly coordinate their spending, but in practice there is little to no enforcement of this rule. Identify the PACs supporting a candidate and then research its largest contributors, its officers and its vendors.

Candidates who have previously run for elected office at the state or local level will have submitted campaign finance reports to the elections authorities in the relevant juridictions. The nature of this data will vary, but to the extent possible, we will seek to replicate our analysis of federal campaign finance data at the state and local level.

Uses:

## Follow the Money
Links:

- https://www.followthemoney.org/


Description: Follow the Money aggregates campaign finance data from the federal, state and local level in a single online database. Because the FEC database is so useful, Follow the Money's primary value is in allowing a nationwide seach of state and local campaign finance data. As a secondary source, any findings from Follow the Money should be verified directly through the relevant elections authority. Searches should still be conducted directly in the databases of any elections authorities in the state and local jurisdictions where a canidate has lived. However, Follow the Money can help us check this research for completeness, and it can identify contributions that a candidate may have made in other jurisdictions, where we may not have known to search.

Uses:

Most people are familiar with the use of quotation marks to search for an exact search term. To exclude a specific term from your results, enter it in the search bar preceded by a dash. For example, -Mintz would eliminate any pages with the term "Mintz" in them. The site: operator returns only results in a particular site or domain. For example, a search including site:.gov would return only results from the .gov domain. Finally, the filetype: operator allows you to return only documents of a certain fileype. For example, a search including filetype:pdf would return only pdf results. This article presents more advanced search term operators: https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/

 - Use other open-source tools as needed


## Law Enforcement Public-Record Requests
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: Public-record requests to law enforcement agencies in the jurisdictions where a candidate has lived can identify police reports naming the candidate that did not result in charges and are therefore not documented in county case indexes. They can also provide otherwise unavailable details on incidents that did result in charges. The same is true of records on calls for service, or calls to 911 requesting service at the candidate's address. 

Our partners will file these requests for us, but we need to compile a list of the relevant law enforcement agencies in order for them to do so. In any given jurisdiction, there will generally be a municipal or county police department -- sometimes both. There will also generally be a county sheriff's office, which is distinct from the county police. And at the state-level, there is generally a state police force, often called a state highway patrol or state troopers.

Uses:
Civil Litigation and Criminal Cases

 - Identify police reports naming a candidate
 - Find information on calls for service to a candidate's residence


## Lexis Nexis
Links:

- lexisnexis.com


Description: Lexis Nexis provides us access to a broad collection of media, much of which would otherwise be behind a paywall. It also has an advantage over Google in that its search returns any documents that match our search terms, whereas Google's algorithm may suppress unpopular results that are nevertheless valuable to our research. If a candidate has had a long career in politics or other closely watched industries, there may be a volume of coverage that makes it impossible to review every "hit" naming the candidate in Lexis Nexis. In these cases, you will need to design search threads to return more limited sets of documents. For example, a "bad word" search might look something like: FIRST NAME /2 LAST NAME AND (CORRUPTION OR FRAUD OR CONTROVERSY OR MISCONDUCT). 

Uses:
Background and Family

Description: The basic features of LinkedIn should be familiar to most researchers. However, before conducting any project related research on LinkedIn, be sure that you are browsing in Private Mode. Navigate to the Settings and Privacy page, select Visibility in the left-hand panel, and click on "Profile Viewing Options." Select Private Mode, and you are ready to conduct research on LinkedIn without disclosing to other users each time you visit their profiles. 

To identify former employees of specific companies, familiarize yourself with the Search feature's Filters, which will allow you to display a list of former employees of a specific company and narrow your results by other criteria such as location.

In some cases, LinkedIn may not allow you to view the full profile of someone outside your network. It is often possible to bypass this restriction by copying the visible text of the profile and then pasting it into the Google search bar. Put the text in quotation marks, and limit your search to the LinkedIn domain by adding site:linkedin.com to your search terms. Your Google search results should include the profile of interest, and by clicking the Google hyperlink, you should be able to view the full profile.

For users who register and log in, Open Corporates also allows a search by registered address as one of its advanced search options. These searches should be conducted for each of the candidate's known addresses. As a secondary source, any information gathered from Open Corporates should be verified by obtaining copies of original documents from the relevant Secretaries of State.

## Other Professional and Business Licensing Bodies
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: Dozens of professions require some form of professional license in most states. These include realtors, CPAs, barbers, general contractors, and private investigators. Restaurants, bars and other retail businesses generally require a municipal license to operate. Licensing details and filings submitted to apply for these types of licenses can be invaluable resources. For example, an application for a liquor license likely needs to disclose the beneficial ownership of the establishment, a detail that is often not included in publicly filed corporate records. Many professionals and business owners also need to disclose any criminal cases or civil judgments filed against them when they apply for these licenses. Review whatever is available online and then consider calling the state or local agency that issued the license to learn what else is publicly available. If a state public-records request is necessary, file one immediately.

## PACER
Links:

- https://pacer.uscourts.gov/


Description: PACER is the database for court records from federal trial and appeals courts. The PACER case index is searchable by case number or party name, and bankruptcy filings are also searchable by the Social Security number of the debtor. All bankruptcies are filed in federal court, so there is no other database to consult for bankruptcies. In most federal cases, all court records are publicly available through PACER, although some records will occasionally be sealed, and very old records will not be online. To access court records, click on the case link from the results page and then select and run the docket report. Be sure that you are not limiting the docket to a timeframe that does not encompass the entirety of the case. 

To understand a case, at a minimum, you will need to read the complaint (or charging document in a criminal case), any opinons and orders on motions to dismiss, any answers filed by defendants, and any records related to the resolution of the case, whether a stipulation of dismissal, jury verdict, judgment, or other record. The same will be true of any state-level cases you identify. You may need to look up certain legal terminology that you encounter. Take your time with any cases and summarize them in clear, concise language as these are often the most important findings on any subject.

Uses:

 - Search for any federal cases - either criminal or civil - in which a candidate is a party
 - Search for any bankruptcy filings by a candidate


Associated People

 - Identify any associates named in court records

## Personal Financial Disclosures
Links:

- Personal Financial Disclosure - House
- Personal Financial Disclosure - Senate
- Office of Government Ethics
- State-level PFD websites and requirements vary by state


Description: Most candidates for elected office are required to submit a personal financial disclosure. The Senate and House each maintain their own databases of financial disclosures, which include both annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports. Annual disclosures present a somewhat comprehensive but imprecise summary of a candidate's assets and liabilities, while periodic transaction reports disclose specific transactions in publicly traded securities, such as sales of publicly traded shares. 

Candidates who have previously served in the executive branch of government may have filed annual financial disclosures and periodic transaction reports with the Office of Government Ethics. Some executive branch officials also sign ethics agreements requiring that they take certain steps to avoid conflicts of interest while in office. For example, a cabinet secretary may agree to recuse himself from any decisions related to a company for which he previously served as a director. These agreements are also maintained in the Office of Government Ethics database.

Candidates who have previously held elected office at the state level will have filed financial disclosures with their state-level election authority, often the Secretary of State. The level of detail in these reports will vary from state to state, and it is not likely that any states require periodic transaction reports such as those required of members of Congress and executive branch officials.

Uses:
Personal Finances

 - Determine which disclosures can be verified in other public records
 - Determine whether the disclosure has omitted assets, income or debts identified in other records
 - Identify additional information on a candidate's finances, such as the candidate's income range and the candidate's financial accounts

Links:

- https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/


Description: The ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer provides access to many of the same records as the IRS Tax-Exempt Organization Search.

Thus, the ProPublica database allows researchers to search for nonprofits in which a specific person has served as an officer, director, key employee or key contractor. The full-text search can also identify organizations that received grants from nonprofits and individuals who made significant contributions to private foundations. The ProPublica database also sometimes has copies of Form 990s that are absent from the IRS database.

Uses:
Nonprofits

 - Verify the existence and nonprofit status of a charity
 - Obtain copies of IRS Form 990s, or annual nonprofit reports
 - Search for references to a candidate in IRS Form 990s

Description: As you conduct your research, consider additional public-record requests to federal, state or local government agencies that might shed further light on issues involving a candidate. For example, if a candidate previously worked for a government agency, we might submit a public-record request for the candidate's professional calendar during that employment. If we know of a specific company that lobbied the candidate in a previous role, we might request any communications between the candidate and that company. Public-record requests will be most effective if they are narrowly targeted and if responsive records will not include personal information requiring redaction.

## Recorders of Deeds
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: The Recorder of Deeds, sometimes referred to as the County Clerk or by some other name, is the official keeper of documents affecting title to real property and also generally records certain other official documents. In most jurisdictions, these records are maintained at the county level, but in some states, such as Connecticut, they are maintained by each town. We will seach for any recorded documents naming a candidate in each of the counties where the candidate is known to have lived or worked. In some jurisdictions, there is no online access to official records, and in these cases, we will order onsite research.

The following common types of records may be filed with the recorder of deeds or equivalent authority:

 - Warranty Deed, documenting the sale of a property
 - Quitclaim Deed, documenting the release or forefeiture of an ownership claim on a property
 - Deed of Trust, or Mortgage, registering a lender's security interest in a property to permit foreclosure in case of default
 - Certificate of Release, or Notice of Satisfaction, documenting the full repayment of a loan and the release of a lender's security interest in a property
 - Mechanic's Lien, documenting a contractor's right to foreclose a property in case of nonpayment for work conducted on it
 - Tax Lien, registering an unpaid tax debt 
 - Judgment, registering a judgment entered by a court
 - Affidavit, in which an individual makes a factual declaration under oath, generally for the purpose of executing a contract
 - Marriage License -- in some jurisdictions these will be recorded publicly with the County Clerk

## SEC Investment Adviser Public Disclosure
Links:

- https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/


Description: Investment advisers are finance professionals who manage funds for investors. They are often called fund managers, and depending on the types of investments they make, they might call their funds hedge funds, private equity funds or venture capital funds. Fund managers with at least $150 million in assets under management must register with the SEC and file a Form ADV, which includes information on the names of the funds that  they manage, the values of these funds, and the officers and beneifical owners of the investment adviser.

## Secretaries of State
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: In most states, the Secretary of State's responsibilities include both chartering companies and administering elections. Some states, such as Arizona, have a distinct agency to charter companies, the Arizona Corporate Commission. Others, such as New York, have a distinct agency to administer elections, the New York State Board of Elections.

As the agency responsible for chartering companies, the Secretary of State generally maintains a database of companies chartered in its jurisdiction. These databases differ in their functionality. For example, the Florida database allows users to search by company name, officer name, and registered address, and it provides free access to all corporate filings, such as a company's articles of incorporation and annual reports. In contrast, the Delaware database only allows users to search by company name, and original copies of filings can only be obtained from a third-party vendor. 

The Secretary of State also generally maintains a database of UCC financing statements. These statements allow a lender to record a security interest in property held by a debtor. As noted above, mortgage lenders generally record their securitiy interests in a debtor's real property at the Recorder of Deeds. So UCC financing statements generally apply to some other type of property, such as accounts receivable, inventory, office equipment, or financial accounts. UCC databases maintained by Secretaries of State often allow a user to search by either the debtor's name or the secured party's name.

As the administrator of elections, the Secretary of State also often provides information on official election results and candidate registrations for both state-level and federal races in its jurisdiction. For state-level candidates, the Secretary of State also often maintains records of any financial disclosures filed by state-level candidates and officeholders as well as campaign finance reports for state-level candidates. The Secretary of State may also keep a database of disclosures filed by lobbyists who lobby the state government. 

If the Secretary of State in the jurisdiction you are researching does not provide access to these records, research the state's government agencies and find the appropriate agency for this research.

Uses:

## Senate Lobbying Disclosure Act Database
Links:

- https://lda.senate.gov/system/public/


Description: Maintained by the Senate, this database includes lobbying disclosure reports for all federal lobbyists. It is searchable by a variety of fields including lobbyist name, lobbyist client, and lobbying firm name.

To search for any former staffers of an executive branch official or member of Congress who are now lobbyists, choose the "Registrations and Quarterly Activity Reports" search. Click "More Search Options" under the "Lobbyist Name" field and then enter the official's name in the "Covered Position Description" and search. This search will return any lobbying reports disclosing lobbyists who previously worked for the official. However, be aware that the Government Accountability Office has repeatedly found that many lobbyists do not properly comply with the requirement to disclose previous positions in government: https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105989.pdf   

To search for any lobbyists who have contributed to a candidate's campaign or funded an event honoring the candidate, choose the "Contributions Search." Expand the search menu under Contribution Entities, and then enter the candidate's name in the "Payee" field. After analyzing these results, go back to the same page, enter the candidate's name in the "Honoree" field and search.

Be aware that the fees reported in lobbying disclosures are rounded to the nearest $10,000, and lobbying firms earning less than $3,000 from a client in a quarter do not need to file a disclosure. If the same firm lobbies on behalf of a client and also provides non-lobbying consulting, legal, or accounting services, fees paid for these other services need not be disclosed.

Guidance on understanding the Lobbying Disclosure Act's reporting requirements can be found here: https://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/ldaguidance.pdf  

Uses:

## State Bar Associations
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.

 - Search for any disciplinary history associated with an attorney license
 - Search for any employment or address history associated with an attorney license

## State DMVs
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: States differ in the availability of vehicle registration information and driving records to the third parties. In many cases, we will not be able to search directly at the state DMV for vehicles registered to a candidate. It is nevertheless good practice to familiarize yourself with the availability of registration and driving records in each state. Some TLO reports include current and historical vehicle registration information, which we can use for leads although as a secondary source, TLO registration data is not authoritative.

Uses:
Personal Finances

 - Identify vehicles registered to a candidate currently and historically


## State Voter Registration Websites
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: Many states offer a public website that allows users to verify voter registrations. States differ in the amount of information that needs to be entered in order to verifya voter registration. For example, some may require only a name and date of birth, whereas others may require a Social Security number. 

States also differ in the accessibility of voter registration information for third parties. If a state voter registrations website clearly indicates that it is only intended for a voter seeking to verify his or her own voter registration information, do not use it to access another person's voter registration.

Uses:
Background and Family

Political History

 - Identify a candidate's voter registration


## State and Local Procurement Databases
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.

## State or County Case Indexes
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: Using the candidate's known address history from TLO and other sources as well as the candidate's professional and educational history, we should have a list of counties in which the candidate has lived, worked, or studied. These should be the same counties in which we searched for any documents naming the candidate at the Recorder of Deeds, described above. We will seach for any civil or criminal cases naming the candidate as a party in each of the counties where the candidate is known to have lived or worked. Consider including certain neighboring counties in your searches if they form part of a larger metropolitan area. For example, a candidate who lived and worked in Cambridge, Massachusetts, might be party to civil cases in either Middlesex County, which includes Cambridge, or Suffolk County, which includes neighboring Boston. In some jurisdictions, there is no online access to state-level court records, and in these cases, we will order onsite research.

The structure of the courts varies from state to state, and the nature and availability of court records also vary from state to state and often from county to county. Briefly familiarize yourself with the structure of the courts in any jurisdiction where the candidate has lived, worked, or studied. We will be focused on trial courts, or first-instance courts, as opposed to appeals courts. Some states have a single, unified level of trial courts which hear all cases. For example, in California the Superior Court is the first-instance court for all cases. In other states, there is a divided trial court structure, with courts of "general jurisdiction" hearing felony criminal cases and high-value civil cases and lower courts that hear misdemeanor criminal cases and small claims civil cases. For example, in New York the trial court of general jurisdiction is named the Supreme Court, and there are a number of lower-level trial courts that hear small claims cases, misdemeanor cases, and landlord-tenant cases.

Conduct research to find all of the relevant courts and their case indexes, and search for any civil or criminal cases naming the canidate. For any cases that you find, write a summary of the case using any records that are available, and save the supporting documents in the project folder. You may need to research unfamiliar legal or financial terminology. Take the time necessary to understand the case thoroughly and present a concise summary of it.

Uses:

Uses:
Civil Litigation and Criminal Cases

 - Identify any criminal cases or convictions for a candidate


## TLO & LexisNexis
Links:

- https://tloxp.tlo.com/login


Description: TLO is a proprietary database that aggregates information from “credit headers,” or the portion of a credit report without financial information, as well as other public and private data. A TLO comprehensive report provides identifying details, address history, associated phone numbers and email addreses and possible employers, among other information. Remember that as a proprietary database, TLO is a secondary source, and anything significant in a TLO report must be verified independently. For this reason, we generally use TLO data to identify leads for further investigation but never as an authoritative source itself. Because of the wide range of data that TLO provides, obtaining and reviewing a TLO report on the candidate is almost always the first step to be taken in any new project.

You will not have direct access to TLO but will receive TLO reports from Sunlight Search staff. Keep TLO in mind and request additional research or reports from Sunlight Staff if you develop leads that require it.

## Tax Assessors
Links:

- Will vary depending on jurisdiction.


Description: Property owners in all 50 states and the District of Columbia owe taxes on real property. Generally, it is the county that collects these taxes, but in some states it is the town. The County Tax Assessor, sometimes referred to as the County Treasurer or by some other name, is responsible for valuing real property in the county and assessing property owners the appropriate amount of tax. Thus, the County Tax Asessor keeps up-to-date information on the current ownership of properties, their boundaries and features, and the taxes owed by property owners. 

In most counties, the tax assessor provides an online database that can be searched by property address, parcel ID, or owner name. In some states, such as California, assessors do not provide the names of property owners because of privacy laws. In many states, assessors provide a satellite map of properties which identifes their owners and boundaries. 

Many states offer homestead exemptions, which reduce the property taxes owed on properties that the owner uses as a primary residence. Consider whether any homestead exemptions claimed by a candidate are consistent with the candidate's voter registration or claimed residence.

In addition to taxing real property, many states also tax "personal property," or any property that is moveable, such as cars, watercraft, product inventory, and office equipment. Determine whether the candidate lives in such a state and whether personal property tax records are publicly available. 

Uses:
Professional History

 - If available, search for any business personal property owned by a business
